    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Comprehensive Guide to Body Fat Percentage</h2>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What Is Body Fat Percentage?</h3>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Your body fat % is the proportion of fat mass compared to lean tissue (muscle, bones, organs). It’s far more insightful than BMI—and essential for understanding what your weight is actually made of.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why It Matters</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>It's more predictive of health risks than weight alone</li>
      <li>Helps define clearer fitness & aesthetic goals</li>
      <li>Tracks muscle gain vs fat loss more accurately</li>
      <li>Guides smarter nutrition & training strategies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How It Works</h3>
    <p className="mb-4">
      We use the validated U.S. Navy method—neck, waist, hips + height—and enhance it with AI pattern recognition from thousands of anonymized data points. It’s fast, smart, and clinical-grade accurate for most users.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Body Fat Categories</h3>
    <p className="mb-4">Here’s a breakdown of body fat categories for men and women:</p>
    <div className="overflow-x-auto">
      <table className="min-w-full bg-white border border-gray-300 mb-4">
        <thead>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How to Use</h3>
    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>Select gender</li>
      <li>Enter height and weight</li>
      <li>Input waist and neck (men) or waist, neck & hips (women)</li>
      <li>Click “Calculate” to view your results</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Scientific Background</h3>
    <p className="mb-4">
      These formulas stem from the Hodgdon & Beckett study (1984) and have been validated against hydrostatic weighing:
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2"><code>Men:</code> % body fat = 86.010 × log10(abdomen - neck) - 70.041 × log10(height) + 36.76</p>
    <p className="mb-4"><code>Women:</code> % body fat = 163.205 × log10(waist + hip - neck) - 97.684 × log10(height) - 78.387</p>

    <FAQAccordion items={[
  {
    question: "How accurate is this calculator?",
    answer: "For most users, it's spot-on. Our AI refines body fat estimations using real-world data and adaptive logic. While clinical tools like DEXA or hydrostatic weighing offer gold-standard precision, this is the next-best thing—for free."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I track body fat?",
    answer: "Every 4–8 weeks is ideal for visual progress tracking and phase recalibration. Weekly check-ins may be too frequent unless you're in an aggressive cut or performance prep."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this while pregnant?",
    answer: "Not recommended. Pregnancy changes body composition dramatically. Speak with a prenatal specialist or physician for safe tracking alternatives."
  },
  {
    question: "Is ultra-low body fat healthy?",
    answer: "Not always. Essential fat supports hormones, immunity, and core organ health. Dropping below your threshold can impact energy and long-term wellness."
