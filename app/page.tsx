            <p className="mb-4">
              Calories are units of energy that your body needs to function. The number of calories you need daily depends on various factors, including your age, gender, height, weight, and activity level. Our AI-powered calculator takes all these factors into account to provide you with a personalized recommendation.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which our calculator uses, has been shown to be one of the most accurate methods for estimating calorie needs. It calculates your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is the number of calories your body burns at rest, and then adjusts this based on your activity level and goals.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Remember, while calorie counting can be an effective tool for weight management, it's important to focus on the quality of your calories as well. A balanced diet rich in whole foods, lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates is key to overall health and sustainable weight management.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Body fat percentage is a measure of body composition that represents the proportion of fat tissue in your body compared to lean tissue (muscles, bones, organs, etc.). Unlike BMI, which doesn't differentiate between fat and muscle mass, body fat percentage provides a more accurate picture of your body composition.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why is Body Fat Percentage Important?</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Understanding your body fat percentage is crucial for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>It's a better indicator of health risks than weight alone</li>
              <li>It helps in setting more precise fitness goals</li>
              <li>It's useful for tracking the effectiveness of diet and exercise regimens</li>
              <li>It provides insights into potential health risks associated with too much or too little body fat</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How is Body Fat Percentage Measured?</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our calculator uses the U.S. Navy method, which has been scientifically validated for its accuracy. This method uses measurements from specific body parts along with height, weight, and gender to estimate body fat percentage. The AI enhancement in our calculator further improves the accuracy by considering additional factors and patterns identified through machine learning algorithms.

            <p className="mb-4">
              The U.S. Navy method for estimating body fat percentage was developed by Hodgdon and Beckett in 1984. It uses the following formulas:
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">For men: % body fat = 86.010 Ã— log10(abdomen - neck) - 70.041 Ã— log10(height) + 36.76</p>
            <p className="mb-4">For women: % body fat = 163.205 Ã— log10(waist + hip - neck) - 97.684 Ã— log10(height) - 78.387</p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              These formulas have been validated against more direct measures of body fat, such as hydrostatic weighing, and have been found to be accurate for most individuals.

                question: "How accurate is the Body Fat Calculator?",
                answer: "Our AI-enhanced Body Fat Calculator, based on the U.S. Navy method, is considered highly accurate for most individuals. However, it's important to note that no estimation method is 100% accurate. For the most precise measurements, methods like DEXA scans or hydrostatic weighing are recommended."
              },
              {
                question: "How often should I measure my body fat percentage?",
                answer: "For most people, measuring body fat percentage once every 4-8 weeks is sufficient to track changes. More frequent measurements may not show significant changes and could lead to unnecessary stress or confusion."
              },
              {
                question: "Can I use this calculator if I'm pregnant?",
                answer: "This calculator is not designed for use during pregnancy. Body composition changes significantly during pregnancy, and specialized methods are required for accurate assessment during this time."

              {
                question: "How can I lower my body fat percentage?",
                answer: "Lowering body fat percentage typically involves a combination of diet and exercise. Focus on creating a slight calorie deficit through a balanced diet rich in protein, fruits, and vegetables, while engaging in both cardiovascular exercise and strength training."

              {
                question: "Is a very low body fat percentage always healthy?",

Essential fat is crucial for normal physiological functions. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine what's healthy for you."
